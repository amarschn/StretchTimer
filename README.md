StretchTimer
============
This is an Android application for my morning stretch routine. I created it to play around with and learn Android.

Currently the app is in a just barely usable state. I want to put this app on the Play Store, as I have not done that yet, so some basic goals for app functionality need to be set. Here goes:

- Display randomized stretches (DONE)
- Display timer for each stretch (DONE)
- Text-To-Speech for each stretch (DONE)
- Drawing of each stretch in stick figure form
- Adjustable timer settings
- App icon

There is a lot more functionality and prettiness that could be thrown in there, but to me this is the bare minimum necessary for the app.
